# glossary_of_security_terms

A simple git page that uses terms and definitions were compiled verbatim from publications from [NIST's](https://www.nist.gov/) cybersecurity- and privacy-related:
- [Federal Information Processing Standards](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips) (FIPS)
- [NIST Special Publications](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/sp) (SPs)
- [NIST Internal/Interagency Reports](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistir) (IRs) 
- Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Instruction [CNSSI-4009](https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Instructions.cfm)

> :warning: **Notice**: Only terms and definitions compiled are from finalized publications and it is highly recommended you always refer to the source publication for the authoritative term and definition, and to see that information in its proper context.
