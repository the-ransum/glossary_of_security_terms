An electromagnetic field at a particular frequency can boost an atom from one energy level to a higher one, or an atom at a high energy level can drop to a lower level by emitting energy. The resonance frequency, fo, of an atomic oscillator is the difference between the two energy levels divided by Planck’s constant, h.\n\nThe principle underlying the atomic oscillator is that since all atoms of a specific element are identical, they should produce exactly the same frequency when they absorb or release energy. In theory, the atom is a perfect “pendulum” whose oscillations are counted to measure a time interval. The national frequency standards developed by NIST and other laboratories derive their resonance frequency from the cesium atom and typically use cesium fountain technology. Rubidium oscillators are the lowest priced and most common atomic oscillators, but cesium beam and hydrogen maser atomic oscillators are also sold commercially in much smaller quantities.","sources":[{"name":"NISTIR 8323","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8323"},{"name":"NIST T&F Glossary","url":"https://www.nist.gov/pml/time-and-frequency-division/popular-links/time-frequency-z"}]},{"term":"Atomic Swap","definition":"An exchange of tokens that does not involve the intervention of any trusted intermediary and automatically reverts if all of the provisions are not met.","sources":[{"name":"NISTIR 8301","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8301"}]},{"term":"attack","definition":"Any kind of malicious activity that attempts to collect, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information system resources or the information itself.","sources":[{"name":"CNSSI 4009-2015","url":"https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Instructions.cfm"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-12 Rev. 1","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-12r1"},{"name":"CNSSI 4009","url":"https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Instructions.cfm"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-30r1"},{"name":"CNSSI 4009","url":"https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Instructions.cfm"},{"name":"NISTIR 8323","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8323"},{"name":"CNSSI 4009-2015","url":"https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Instructions.cfm"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-82 Rev. 2","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-82r2"},{"name":"CNSSI 4009","url":"https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Instructions.cfm"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-28 Version 2","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-28ver2"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-63-3","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63-3"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-63-2","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63-2"}]},{"term":"attack sensing and warning (AS&W)","definition":"Detection, correlation, identification, and characterization of intentional unauthorized activity with notification to decision makers so that an appropriate response can be developed.","sources":[{"name":"CNSSI 4009-2015","url":"https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Instructions.cfm"}]},{"term":"attack signature","definition":"A specific sequence of events indicative of an unauthorized access attempt.","sources":[{"name":"CNSSI 4009-2015","url":"https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Instructions.cfm"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-12","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-12"}]},{"term":"attack surface","definition":"The set of points on the boundary of a system, a system element, or an environment where an attacker can try to enter, cause an effect on, or extract data from, that system, system element, or environment.","sources":[{"name":"NIST SP 800-172","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-171r2"},{"name":"GAO-19-128","url":"https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/694913.pdf"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-160 Vol. 2","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-160v2"},{"name":"GAO-19-128","url":"https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/694913.pdf"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r5"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-160 Vol. 2 Rev. 1","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-160v2r1"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r5"}]},{"term":"attack tree","definition":"A branching, hierarchical data structure that represents a set of potential approaches to achieving an event in which system security is penetrated or compromised in a specified way.","sources":[{"name":"CNSSI 4009-2015","url":"https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Instructions.cfm"},{"name":"IETF RFC 4949 Ver 2","url":"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4949"}]},{"term":"attacker","definition":"A party, including an insider, who acts with malicious intent to compromise a system.","sources":[{"name":"NIST SP 800-63-3","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63-3"},{"name":"NISTIR 8053","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8053"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-63-2","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63-2"}]},{"term":"attended","definition":"Under continuous positive control of personnel authorized for access or use.","sources":[{"name":"CNSSI 4009-2015","url":"https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Instructions.cfm"},{"name":"CNSSI 4005","url":"https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Instructions.cfm"}]},{"term":"attribute","definition":"An attribute is any distinctive feature, characteristic, or property of an object that can be identified or isolated quantitatively or qualitatively by either human or automated means.","sources":[{"name":"CNSSI 4009-2015","url":"https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Instructions.cfm"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-95","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-95"},{"name":"Web Services Glossary -

This new DNSKEY RR, in turn, authenticates another DNSKEY RRSet and, in turn, some DNSKEY RR in this set may be used to authenticate another DS RR, and so forth until the chain finally ends with a DNSKEY RR whose corresponding private key signs the desired DNS data. For example, the root DNSKEY RRSet can be used to authenticate the DS RRSet for “example.” The “example.” DS RRSet contains a hash that matches some “example.” DNSKEY, and this DNSKEY’s corresponding private key signs the “example.” DNSKEY RRSet. Private key counterparts of the “example.” DNSKEY RRSet sign data records such as “www.example.” as well as DS RRs for delegations such as “subzone.example.”","sources":[{"name":"NIST SP 800-81-2","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-81-2"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-81-2","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-81-2"}]},{"term":"Authentication code","definition":"A keyed cryptographic checksum based on an approved security function; also known as a Message Authentication Code.","sources":[{"name":"NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev. 5","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r5"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev. 4","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r4"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev. 3","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-57p1r3"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-57 Part 2","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-57p2"}]},{"term":"Authentication Factor","definition":"The three types of authentication factors aresomething you know,something you have, andsomething you are.

The group responsible for defending an enterprise’s use of information systems by maintaining its security posture against a group of mock attackers (i.e., the Red Team). Typically, the Blue Team and its supporters must defend against real or simulated attacks 1) over a significant period of time, 2) in a representative operational context (e.g., as part of an operational exercise), and 3) according to rules established and monitored with the help of a neutral group refereeing the simulation or exercise (i.e., the White Team). \n2. The term Blue Team is also used for defining a group of individuals that conduct operational network vulnerability evaluations and provide mitigation techniques to customers who have a need for an independent technical review of their network security posture. The Blue Team identifies security threats and risks in the operating environment, and in cooperation with the customer, analyzes the network environment and its current state of security readiness. Based on the Blue Team findings and expertise, they provide recommendations that integrate into an overall community security solution to increase the customer's cyber security readiness posture. Often times a Blue Team is employed by itself or prior to a Red Team employment to ensure that the customer's networks are as secure as possible before having the Red Team test the systems.","sources":[{"name":"NIST SP 800-161","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161"},{"name":"CNSSI 4009","url":"https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Instructions.cfm"},{"name":"NISTIR 7622","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.7622"},{"name":"CNSSI 4009-2010","url":"https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Instructions.cfm"}]},{"term":"RED wireline","definition":"A metallic wire that carries a RED signal or that originates/terminates in a RED equipment or system.","sources":[{"name":"CNSSI 4009-2015","url":"https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Instructions.cfm"},{"name":"CNSSAM TEMPEST/01-13","url":"https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Memoranda.cfm"}]},{"term":"RED/BLACK concept","definition":"Separation of electrical and electronic circuits, components, equipment, and systems that handle national security information (RED), in electrical form, from those that handle non-national security information (BLACK) in the same form.","sources":[{"name":"CNSSI 4009-2015","url":"https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Instructions.cfm"},{"name":"CNSSAM TEMPEST/01-13","url":"https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Memoranda.cfm"},{"name":"NSTISSI No. 7002","url":"https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Instructions.cfm"}]},{"term":"Redundant Control Server","definition":"A backup to the control server that maintains the current state of the control server at all times.","sources":[{"name":"NIST SP 800-82 Rev. 2","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-82r2"},{"name":"NISTIR 6859","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.6859"}]},{"term":"Reference","definition":"See Informative Reference.","sources":[{"name":"NISTIR 8278","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8278"},{"name":"NISTIR 8278A","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8278A"}]},{"term":"Reference Document","definition":"A cybersecurity document that is related to the Framework.","sources":[{"name":"NISTIR 8204","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8204"},{"name":"NISTIR 8278","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8278"},{"name":"NISTIR 8278A","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8278A"}]},{"term":"Reference Document Element","definition":"A discrete section, sentence, phrase, or other identifiable piece of content of a Reference Document.","sources":[{"name":"NISTIR 8278","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8278"},{"name":"NISTIR 8278A","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8278A"}]},{"term":"Reference Implementation","definition":"the implementation of a standard to be used as a definitive interpretation for the requirements in that standard.

These commands typically execute substantially faster than attempting to rewrite through the native read and write interface. The ATA standard clearly identifies that the Sanitization operations must address user data areas, user data areas not currently allocated (including “previously allocated areas and physical sectors that have become inaccessible”), and user data caches. The resulting media contents vary based on the command used. The overwrite command allows the user to specify the data pattern applied to the media, so that pattern (or the inverse of that pattern, if chosen) will be written to the media (although the actual contents of the media may vary due to encoding). The result of the block erase command is vendor unique, but will likely be 0s or 1s. The result of the crypto scramble command is vendor unique, but will likely be cryptographically scrambled data (except for areas that were not encrypted, which are set to the value the vendor defines).","sources":[{"name":"NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-88r1"}]},{"term":"SAO","definition":"Senior Authorizing Official; A senior organization official that has budgetary control, provides oversight, develops policy, and has authority over all functions and services provided by the issuer.","sources":[{"name":"NIST SP 800-79-2","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-79-2"}]},{"term":"SAOP","definition":"The senior official, designated by the head of each agency, who has agency-wide responsibility for privacy, including implementation of privacy protections; compliance with Federal laws, regulations, and policies relating to privacy; management of privacy risks at the agency; and a central policy-making role in the agency’s development and evaluation of legislative, regulatory, and other policy proposals.","sources":[{"name":"NISTIR 8062","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8062"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r4"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-53A Rev. 4","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53Ar4"}]},{"term":"SAP","definition":"A program established for a specific class of classified information that imposes safeguarding and access requirements that exceed those normally required for information at the same classification level.","sources":[{"name":"NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r4"},{"name":"CNSSI 4009","url":"https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Instructions.cfm"}]},{"term":"Satisfaction","definition":"Freedom from discomfort, and positive attitudes towards the use of the product.","sources":[{"name":"NISTIR 8040","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8040"}]},{"term":"S-box","definition":"Non-linear substitution table used in several byte substitution transformations and in the Key Expansion routine to perform a one-for-one substitution of a byte value.","sources":[{"name":"FIPS 197","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.197"}]},{"term":"SC","definition":"The process of determining the security category for information or an information system.

The normal erase, as defined in the standard, is only required to address data in the contents of LBA 0 through the greater of READ NATIVE MAX or READ NATIVE MAX EXT, and replaces the contents with 0s or 1s. The enhanced erase command specifies that, “…all previously written user data shall be overwritten, including sectors that are no longer in use due to reallocation” and the contents of the media following Sanitization are vendor unique. The actual action performed by an enhanced erase varies by vendor and model, and could include a variety of actions that have varying levels of effectiveness. The secure erase command is not defined in the SCSI standard, so it does not apply to media with a SCSI interface.","sources":[{"name":"NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-88r1"}]},{"term":"secure hash algorithm (SHA)","definition":"A hash algorithm with the property that it is computationally infeasible 1) to find a message that corresponds to a given message digest, or 2) to find two different messages that produce the same message digest.","sources":[{"name":"CNSSI 4009-2015","url":"https://www.cnss.gov/CNSS/issuances/Instructions.cfm"},{"name":"FIPS 180-4","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.180-4"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-22 Rev. 1a","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-22r1a"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-89","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-89"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-56B Rev. 1","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-56Br1"},{"name":"NIST SP 800-70 Rev. 3","url":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-70r3"}]},{"term":"Secure Hash Algorithm 256","definition":"A hash algorithm that can be used to generate digests of messages.
